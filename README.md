# SimpleNeuralNetwork
A simple Neural Network library written with the Efficient Java Matrix Library (EJML)

Successfully trained on MNIST. Achieved 95.07% accuracy using 784 inputs, 1 hidden layer with 128 neurons, 10 outputs, Sigmoid on all layers and 45 minutes of training. 

RELU, Leaky RELU have been added. Softmax is under development. Hopefully these will improve accuracy.
